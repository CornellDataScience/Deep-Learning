# Intelligent Systems Alumni and History
## Fall 2017 Cohort
The  team was founded as the "Deep Learning Functional Subteam". It was initially designed to be where knowledge specific to deep learning would be accumulated and to help other subteams/projects use deep learning techniques. It was also during this semester that the Deep Learning deep dives were created by the team founders. These lectures were designed to help teach undergraduate and graduate students the very basics of deep learning and boost internal and external expertise in the area, improving CDS's competencies in the area and enabling students with no prior experience with the field to attend the workshops and be better prepared to interview for positions in CDS. The first GPU that CDS owned, an Nvidia GTX Titan Xp, was approved by eboard and purchased, enabling members to train neural networks. The team projects were focused on acquiring basic knowledge in deep learning applied to NLP and computer vision tasks.

## Spring 2018 Cohort
The team was renamed to the "Deep Learning Subteam" and became of the three primary teams around which CDS was completely reorganized. Recruitment processes were revised to have all members apply to one of the subteams and to be more fair towards applicants with no prior data science or machine learning experience. Additionally, the internal training program for new members was developed. The team was significantly expanded, with an emphasis on recruiting younger members, primarily sophomores and freshmen. The first custom built server was designed and built by Ryan Butler and Luca Leeser in order to house the GPU purchased during Fall 2017, as well as enable heavier multithreaded CPU workloads and room to expand to up to three additional GPUs (four total). The team also forayed for the first time into genomics, bayesian neural networks, reinforcement learning, and music generation, and continued researching deep learning based NLP and computer vision.

## Fall 2018 Cohort
The team was renamed to the "Intelligent Systems Subteam". The team continued to gain experience in computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, as well research on new algorithms for machine learning models. The GPU server was for the first time used by most teams, and also saw the first parallelized use of the CPU combined with GPU for reinforcement learning. Furthermore, the team had its first official collaboration with a company, IBM, giving the team access to proprietary data. The first large group of newly trained members (Spring 2018 cohort), had their first full semester projects during which they reapplied the knowledge the gained from their own exploration in the field, internal training program, external training program, and deep learning lecture series.
