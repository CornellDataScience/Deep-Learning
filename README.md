**Team Leads:** Ryan Butler (CS '19) and Kevin Luo (CS '20)  
**Advisor:** Prof. Bharath Hariharan

## About Us
The Deep Learning (DL) Subteam is one of three subteams in [Cornell Data Science](cornelldata.science), a student led undergraduate project team at Cornell University. You can take a look at some of our repositories to see our individual work.

## This Semester

This semester, we are doing some stuff.

* ### [**Subproject A**](/SubprojectA)

   **Members:** Xuwen Shen (STAT '18), Xinzhe Yang (CS '20)   
   In order to give insights to overall ratings and then create a new personalized recommendation system based on the rating that account for his or her preferences, we were hoping to extract hidden information in reviews including an individual user’s preference and a business’s properties (scores for each feature of the business). Finally, we created a model combining the topics and overall ratings to get a personalized ratings for a specific user.

* ### [**Neural Style Transfer For Text**](/dl_style_transfer)   
  **Members:** Luca Leeser (INFO '18), Yuji Akimoto (ORIE '19), Ryan Butler (CS '19), Cameron Ibrahim (ORIE '20)   
  We are seeking to modify the neural style transfer algorithm proposed by [Gatys et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) to make it applicable to text. Our goal is to devise an algorithm that is able to transfer the writing style of one review onto the content of another.
